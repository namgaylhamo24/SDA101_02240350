**Main Concepts Applied:**
In this task, I used key **HTML** and **CSS** techniques:
- **Semantic HTML**: I used meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<form>` to structure the page properly.
- **Flexbox**: I applied Flexbox for easy layout control, helping align elements neatly, especially in the office information and card sections.
- **CSS Grid**: I used CSS Grid for more complex layouts, like the hero section and the form.
- **Responsive Design**: I added media queries to make sure the webpage adjusts well across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

**New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:**
- **CSS Grid**: I gained deeper knowledge of CSS Grid, which was new to me compared to Flexbox, and used it to handle more complex layouts.
- **Design Analysis**: Learning to break down a design and convert it into code helped me think more like a designer.
- **Accessibility**: I improved my understanding of accessibility, like adding descriptive **alt** text for images and using semantic HTML to help screen readers.

#### Reflection 

**What I Learned:**
This task highlighted the importance of having a clear **HTML structure** for easy maintenance. I also realized how important **responsive design** is, ensuring that the page looks good on all screen sizes from the beginning. Understanding **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** better helped me organize content efficiently across different devices.

I also learned how small changes in **typography, spacing**, and margins can greatly improve how readable and attractive a webpage looks.

**Challenges Faced:**
- **Layout Alignment**: Aligning the hero section (the image and the "Contact Us" text) across devices was tricky. I tried different ways to fix it and eventually used **absolute positioning** inside a **relative container** to keep the text centered.

- **Form Responsiveness**: At first, the form didn't resize well on smaller screens, causing the form and contact details to overlap. I solved this by applying **flex-direction: column** and adjusting widths with **media queries**.

Through these challenges, I gained a better understanding of how to approach similar issues in the future.
