#### Main Concepts Applied:
I utilized the following key concepts:

- *Ordered and Unordered Lists*: The main structure involved creating an ordered list (<ol>) for the college events, with each eventâ€™s details (time and location) nested inside an unordered list (<ul>). This helped logically present hierarchical information.
  
- *Custom Bullets and Numbers*:I customized the numbers in an ordered list using CSS properties like list-style-type and counter-increment for a more visually engaging and unique list.

- *Hover Effects*: I implemented hover effects using the: hover pseudo-class. When a user hovers over a specific event, the background and text color change, enhancing interactivity and user experience.

- *Spacing and Padding*: To ensure readability, I used padding and margin adjustments to create proper spacing between list items. This improved the overall look and prevented the text from appearing cluttered.


#### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
I learned how to customize lists using CSS, including custom bullets or numbers and hover effects to make the content more interactive. I also reinforced my understanding of the importance of padding and spacing for readability and user experience.

#### What I Learned:
I learned how to make cool lists in HTML using CSS. I can now customize list markers, add hover effects, and adjust padding to style content better. I realized that even small design elements like custom bullets and hover effects can make a page look better and easier to use.

#### Challenges Faced:
I had some challenges with making custom bullets look the same on all browsers, but I fixed it by using **list-style-position: inside** and resetting default styles with a CSS reset rule.

I also had trouble with hover effects being too overwhelming, so I adjusted the colors to make them subtler and made the text bold instead of changing its color.

#### Conclusion:
I learned how to create structured and styled lists using HTML and CSS. Overcoming challenges with browser consistency and hover effects improved my problem-solving skills. It also highlighted the importance of considering user experience and cross-browser compatibility. The end result was a well-structured, interactive, and visually appealing list of college events.
