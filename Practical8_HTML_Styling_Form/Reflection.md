#### Main Concepts Applied:
For this task, the following concepts were applied in building and styling the form:

- *CSS Styling*: I focused on creating a modern, clean aesthetic for the form. Consistent styling was applied to inputs, text areas, and the submit button. A soft color scheme with neutral tones and accent colors was used to ensure readability without overwhelming the user.

- *Input Types and Placeholders*: Remember to use text for name, number for room number, and email for contact information. Placeholders were added to provide guidance on what should be entered in each field.

- *Focus State Styling*: I styled the focus states of form elements using CSS pseudo-classes like :focus. This ensured a user-friendly experience where inputs were highlighted on focus, making navigation smoother and providing visual feedback.

- *Button Styling*: The submit button was styled to stand out by using a bright accent color, rounded corners, and a slightly larger font size. I also added hover and active states to give the button a tactile, clickable feel.

#### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
I learned a lot about using form elements in HTML, including the importance of using the right input types for validation and accessibility. I also improved my skills in styling form elements consistently and designing user-friendly focus states. I learned how to make a submit button visually distinct while ensuring accessibility.

#### What I Learned:
I learned how to design forms that are functional and aesthetically pleasing by applying CSS to create a modern look while keeping the user interface simple and intuitive. I also gained practical experience in styling form states like hover and focus to improve the user experience.

I made sure to style the form elements to give clear visual feedback to the user while maintaining functionality. I learned that using the right input types can improve the form's accessibility and ease of use.

#### Challenges Faced:
I had two main challenges. First, I had to make sure the form looked good and worked well on small screens. I used CSS Flexbox and media queries to make it mobile-friendly.

Second, I needed to choose colors that made the form easy to read for everyone. I used contrast testing tools to pick colors with better contrast, so the form is clear for all users.

#### 
All in all , I learned a lot about form structure and styling in HTML and CSS while working on this task. I had to consider design, user experience, accessibility, and responsiveness. Overcoming challenges related to mobile responsiveness and contrast helped me create a clean, modern, and functional form that works well on different devices.
