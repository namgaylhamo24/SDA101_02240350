#### Main Concepts Applied:
I designed the landing page for a fictional e-commerce site selling tech gadgets with a focus on:
- Using key HTML elements to structure the page for better accessibility and SEO.
- Creating a responsive grid-based layout for product listings using CSS Grid.
- Using relative units for better scalability across different screen sizes.

#### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
Through this project, I improved my knowledge of *CSS Grid* and *Flexbox* for layouts. I also became more comfortable using *media queries* and understanding the importance of breakpoints in responsive design. Additionally, I strengthened my skills in *using relative units* to make the site adaptable to different screen sizes.

#### What I Learned:
I learned about using semantic HTML to create accessible web pages and practiced using CSS Grid for flexible layout design. I also improved my skills in responsive design for different devices.

#### Challenges Faced:
I faced a couple of challenges while working on the website. One was making sure that the product grid looked good on all screen sizes. At first, the grid didn't adjust well on smaller screens, and the images and text didn't fit properly. To fix this, I used media queries to change the number of columns in the grid based on the screen size. This made the grid look better on tablets and mobiles.

Another challenge was getting the text on the main image to stay centered and adjust when the browser window was resized.

#### Conclusion:
I strengthened my skills in modern web development, particularly in responsive design and semantic HTML. Overcoming challenges with grid layout  improved my problem-solving skills.
