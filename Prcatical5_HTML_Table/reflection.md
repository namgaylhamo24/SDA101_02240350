On creating an HTML timetable using tables and CSS. Here are the main concepts I applied:

1. HTML Table Structure: I used <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags to organize the timetable by representing days of the week as columns and time slots as rows.

2. Semantic HTML: I made sure to use tags for their appropriate purpose, such as using <th> for headers to make the data accessible for screen readers.

3. Table Layout: I used colspan and rowspan attributes to span multiple columns or rows where necessary, such as for courses that lasted for more than one time slot.

4. Styling with CSS: Basic CSS was used to style the table, including borders, background colors for headings, and padding within table cells for clarity.

I also acquired new skills and knowledge, such as table manipulation, responsive design, and accessibility considerations. I learned how to effectively manipulate tables, make the table responsive for different devices, and consider proper table headers for accessibility.

Overall, this experience helped me deepen my understanding of HTML tables and improved my problem-solving skills when facing challenges such as overlapping time slots and alignment issues.
