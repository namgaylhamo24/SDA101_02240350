## Main Concept applied were *:
   - *Unordered Lists* (<ul>): This was used for the list of courses and to-do items, as well as for the outer structure of the nested list for study goals.
   - *Ordered Lists* (<ol>): This was utilized for the class schedule and subtopics under each main study topic. Ordered lists helped convey the sequence of class timings and the structure of subtopics under each main subject.
   - *Nested Lists*: For study goals, I used a combination of unordered and ordered lists to reflect the hierarchy of topics and their subtopics, which helped me organize complex data more effectively.

## New Skills or Knowledge Acquired*:
   - I gained a deeper understanding of how to nest lists within other lists. This became particularly useful in the study goals section, where I had to combine unordered and ordered lists to show a relationship between topics and subtopics.
   - I also learned more about HTML structuring techniques, such as when to use ordered versus unordered lists based on whether the sequence of the information was relevant.

## What I Learned*:
   Through this task, I enhanced my knowledge of HTML and list structuring. I realized how critical it is to choose the right list types for specific content. For example, using an unordered list for the course list makes sense as there is no particular order in which the courses should be presented. Meanwhile, the class schedule requires an ordered list since time-based information needs a clear sequence. Additionally, I learned the practical value of nested lists, especially for complex content like study goals that have a clear hierarchy.

 ## Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them*:
   - **Challenge 1:** Nesting Lists Correctly*:
     One challenge I faced was ensuring that the nesting of lists was properly aligned in the study goals section. Initially, I missed the closing tags for some of the ordered lists within the unordered list.
   
   - **Challenge 2:** Understanding List Layout*:
     Another challenge was understanding the visual impact of different list types when presented on a web page. The default styles for <ul> and <ol> created some visual clutter, especially with nested lists. To overcome this, I experimented with custom CSS to adjust the margins and padding of each list to create a cleaner appearance, making the nested lists more readable.

     In Conclusion, this assignment  helped me think about the practical aspects of presenting hierarchical data on a web page.
