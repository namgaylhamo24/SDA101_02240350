#### Concepts Applied:
I organized my grades using the basic structure of an HTML table. I created column headers (Module, Assignment/Exam Name, Maximum Marks, Marks Obtained, Percentage, Grade) using the <th> element, and filled in the data using <td> elements.

To style the table, I used CSS to ensure consistent spacing, proper text alignment, and added borders to the table and cells.
#### New Knowledge Acquired:
I learned a lot about creating HTML tables and styling them with CSS. 


#### What I Learned:
I learned how important it is to organize data in a structured format, like using an HTML table. It's essential for tracking and analyzing information. Creating a table for grades showed me how useful tables are for displaying structured data, allowing for clear comparison across different fields like modules, assignments, and scores.

I also learned that CSS styling can greatly improve the user experience by enhancing the table's appearance. Simple features like alternating row colors and clear borders make the data more readable and visually engaging.

#### Challenges Faced:
I had some challenges with making a table readable as the data increased. To fix this, I used CSS for padding and text alignment to create more space between the cells. I also used border-collapse: collapse to clean up the table borders. Another challenge was ensuring accurate percentages and grades in the table. I manually calculated the percentages for each row.

In conclusion,I gained valuable experience working with HTML tables to present structured data. It reinforced the importance of styling for readability and aesthetics. Overcoming layout and accuracy challenges made me appreciate the role of HTML for structure and CSS for design.
